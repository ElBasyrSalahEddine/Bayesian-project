# Movie Rating Prediction
Led an in-depth analysis project leveraging R programming and Bayesian methodologies to investigate the determinants of movie audience scores. The project encompassed comprehensive stages:
1.	Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
  Curated a dataset comprising 651 pre-2016 movies sourced from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.   Ensured data integrity through meticulous preprocessing steps, including feature engineering.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Conducted rigorous EDA, employing statistical summaries and visualizations to unveil audience score distribution patterns.
  Uncovered noteworthy trends such as the impact of genre and critical ratings on audience reception.
3.	Model Development and Selection:
  Constructed a robust linear regression model and evaluated its efficacy in predicting audience scores.
  Applied Bayesian model averaging (BMA) techniques to discern influential predictors and identify the most optimal model configuration.
4.	Prediction and Validation:
  Utilized the finalized model to forecast audience scores for "La La Land," a 2016 release, achieving close alignment (82.3) with actual scores (81).
  Rigorously validated model performance and addressed potential limitations, offering avenues for future refinement.
5.	Insights and Recommendations:
  Derived actionable insights, highlighting factors such as runtime, IMDb ratings, and critical acclaim as significant determinants of audience perception.
  Presented recommendations for enhancing model robustness and expanding the scope of analyses for deeper insights into movie audience dynamics.
